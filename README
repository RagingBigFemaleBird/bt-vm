    Virtual Machine using Breakpoint Tracing
    Copyright (C) 2012 Bi Wu

Refer to my dissertation for details

Instructions:
To compile,

	make ARCH=x86

	gcc -lncurses ncurse.c -o vm-term

To run,

	insmod btc.ko
	cat floppy-linux.img > /proc/btc
        mknod /dev/btc0 c your_device_number 0
	./vm-term /dev/btc0 0 32768

vm-term is the ncurse client to observe virtual machine output.
when vm-term is running:
F5 pause VM and bring up menu, in menu:
  press R to resume/pause VM execution  (always do this first. VM is by default paused)
  press B to place debug breakpoints
  press S to single step (not guaranteed to work)
HOME key scrolls up
END key scrolls down
other keys will be sent to VM, currently only accept a-z, 1-0, enter, space, backspace


Common problems:

vmalloc is not big enough: increase vmalloc size via boot parameter
random crashes: SMP need fixing but I was too lazy to do it
